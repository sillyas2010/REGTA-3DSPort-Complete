# REGTA-3DSPort-Complete

REGTA brings three classic Grand Theft Auto games to New Nintendo 3DS:

- **Grand Theft Auto III**, based on re3 (`III`)
- **Grand Theft Auto: Vice City**, based on reVC (`miami`)
- **Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories**, based on
  [reStories/reLCS](https://github.com/knackers4/res) (`stories`)

Trailer：https://youtu.be/fBzzLx0BX5M

## The games today

### GTA III

- Dark-blue lower-screen interface.
- Faster loading and smoother streaming.
- Removed motion blur; fixed vehicle materials and several crashes.
- Final-mission music: 'push it to the limit'.

Tested on New Nintendo 3DS. Busy scenes can still drop frames.
Uses **PC GTA III data**. [Setup and controls →](III/README.md)

### Vice City

- Pink lower-screen interface.
- Faster loading; restored particles and vehicle highlights.
- Fixed character and vehicle polygons, water seams and flight-related crashes.
- Final-mission music: 'Self Control'.

Tested on New Nintendo 3DS. Demanding scenes can still cause frame drops or
audio stutter. Uses **PC Vice City data**. [Setup and controls →](miami/README.md)

### Liberty City Stories

- Completed the unfinished [reStories/reLCS](https://github.com/knackers4/res)
  campaign implementation for New Nintendo 3DS.
- Red lower-screen interface and lightweight vehicle reflections.
- Fixed missions, saves, world changes, cutscenes and vehicle bugs.
- Custom text cheats and final-mission music: 'Chase'.

**Main story completed on a physical New Nintendo 3DS.** Side missions and
other optional activities are not yet verified. Please [report problems](#reporting-bugs)
with reproduction steps and any screenshots, video or crash dump.

Uses **converted PS2 LCS data**. [Setup, controls and cheats →](stories/README.md)

## Supported hardware

- New Nintendo 3DS
- New Nintendo 3DS XL
- New Nintendo 2DS XL
- A homebrew-capable system for 3DSX builds, or custom firmware for CIA builds

Old Nintendo 3DS, Old Nintendo 3DS XL and Nintendo 2DS systems are not
supported. These ports use the New 3DS's faster CPU, L2 cache and extra memory.

Before gameplay, the renderer requires the New 3DS MVD service to prepare its
neutral material texture. The check runs late in game loading, after TXD index
preparation and animation/model loading (around the 80% stage in VC). Startup
and menu rendering use a temporary neutral texture so existing game fonts are
available for the failure message. Skipping movies or using cached TXDs does
not bypass the check. Without working conversion, both screens turn black and
the upper screen displays "Device not supported" in the normal help-text font.
B exits, and HOME remains handled by the normal APT loop.
This new renderer path is experimental and still needs physical-console
validation, including both CIA and 3DSX service access.

## Project layout

All three games and their shared dependencies live in this repository.
Download it once, then choose which game to build; there are no separate game
repositories or branches to assemble.

```text
REGTA-3DSPort-Complete/
├── common/       shared 3DS renderer, audio and platform dependencies
├── III/          GTA III / re3 game tree
├── miami/        Vice City / reVC game tree
├── stories/      Liberty City Stories / reLCS game tree

├── packaging/    CIA scripts and finished CGFX banners, audio and icons
├── tools/        shared host-side utilities
└── docs/         historical implementation and verification notes
```

Keep the repository layout and symbolic links intact, even when building only
one game. Each game's `vendor` folder links to the shared libraries in `common`.

### The three game trees

| Source tree | Game | Original data source | SD data path | 3DSX filename |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `III` | Grand Theft Auto III | PC | `sdmc:/3ds/re3/` | `re3.3dsx` |
| `miami` | Grand Theft Auto: Vice City | PC | `sdmc:/3ds/miami/` | `revc.3dsx` |
| `stories` | Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories | PS2 | `sdmc:/3ds/relcs/` | `relcs.3dsx` |

Vice City uses `/3ds/miami` for data and `revc.3dsx` for the executable.
Older reLCS builds may have used `/3ds/restories`; move that `userfiles` folder
to `/3ds/relcs` before removing an old installation.

## Quick start

Install the [build dependencies](#host-prerequisites) first.
Then, from the repository root:

```sh
./scripts/setup-game.sh relcs "/path/to/extracted/LCS/PS2/data" "/Volumes/SD/3ds"
./scripts/build.sh relcs
./scripts/install-3dsx.sh relcs "/Volumes/SD/3ds"
```

Replace `relcs` with `re3` or `revc` and provide the corresponding PC game
directory when preparing either PC title.

Installing the executable does not install the game data. Both CIA and 3DSX
builds load it from the matching folder under `sdmc:/3ds/`.

## Preparing game data

Run the interactive helper with no arguments:

```sh
./scripts/setup-game.sh
```

It asks for:

1. `re3`, `revc` or `relcs`;
2. the original game-data directory;
3. the mounted SD card's `/3ds` directory, not the SD root.

The same operation can be scripted:

```sh
./scripts/setup-game.sh re3   "/path/to/GTA III"       "/Volumes/SD/3ds"
./scripts/setup-game.sh revc  "/path/to/Vice City"     "/Volumes/SD/3ds"
./scripts/setup-game.sh relcs "/path/to/extracted LCS" "/Volumes/SD/3ds"
```

The helper copies the required data without changing the original files. It
leaves out desktop executables and temporary files, then copies selected
overrides from the root `gamefiles/<game>` folder. Existing saves in the
destination's `userfiles` folder are preserved.

See [gamefiles](gamefiles/README.md) for the included overrides. Original models,
radio stations and other base data must come from your own game.

### Expected SD data layout

This layout matches the files used for testing on a physical console:

```text
sdmc:/3ds/
├── re3/
│   ├── TEXT/  anim/  audio/music/  data/  models/  movies/  mp3/  txd/
│   ├── models/txd.img  models/txd.dir
│   ├── re3.ini
│   └── userfiles/
├── miami/
│   ├── Audio/music/  TEXT/  anim/  data/  models/  movies/  mp3/  txd/
│   ├── models/txd.img  models/txd.dir
│   ├── reVC.ini
│   └── userfiles/
└── relcs/
    ├── AUDIO/{CUTSCENE,MUSIC,NEWS}/  DATA/  TEXT/  anim/  models/
    ├── movies/  neo/  txd/
    ├── models/txd.img  models/txd.dir
    ├── reLCS.ini
    └── userfiles/
```

Keep the documented letter case even if the SD card itself is case-insensitive:
staging and verification may occur on a case-sensitive host. GTA III uses
`audio`, Vice City uses `Audio`, and LCS uses `AUDIO`; LCS data uses `DATA`.
The final-mission tracks therefore live at:

```text
re3/audio/music/PUSH_FM.WAV        re3/audio/music/PUSH_LOOP.WAV
miami/Audio/music/SELF_FM.WAV      miami/Audio/music/SELF_LOOP.WAV
relcs/AUDIO/MUSIC/CHASE_FM.WAV     relcs/AUDIO/MUSIC/CHASE_LOOP.WAV
```

The setup helper copies these included overrides:

| Game | Included data overrides |
| --- | --- |
| GTA III | `TEXT/american.gxt`, `audio/music`, `data/PARTICLE.CFG`, `data/main_d.scm`, `data/main_freeroam.scm`, `movies` |
| Vice City | `Audio/music`, `TEXT/american.gxt`, `data/particle.cfg`, `movies` |
| LCS | `AUDIO/MUSIC`, `movies`, `txd/LOADSC0.TXD` |

The remaining files come from your original game data or are generated by the
port. If you add an override, update both this list and the setup helper.

A clean install creates default `.ini` settings on first launch. Keep your own
settings and saves in `userfiles`; there is no need to copy someone else's.
Keep the generated `models/txd.img` and `models/txd.dir` texture cache too—it
makes a substantial difference to loading and streaming speed.

Desktop DLLs, old executables, logs and converter utilities left over from an
earlier installation are not needed on the SD card.

### Liberty City Stories data and audio

Prepare your PS2 assets with the
[reLCS Asset Converter from reStories](https://github.com/knackers4/res/releases/tag/relcs)
first. Its Windows executable is named `reLCSAssetConverter.exe`; see the
[upstream instructions](https://github.com/knackers4/res#how-can-i-try-it).
REGTA's setup helper expects converted assets, not just the contents of an
extracted ISO.

Select the prepared PS2 data folder containing:

```text
DATA/gta_lcs.DAT
models/gta3.img
AUDIO/sfx.RAW
AUDIO/MUSIC/*.VB
AUDIO/NEWS/*.VB
AUDIO/CUTSCENE/*.VB
```

REGTA's audio-conversion step requires `ffmpeg` and a host C++ compiler. It converts the 19
continuous music/radio streams to 24 kHz mono IMA ADPCM WAV, avoiding the
real-time cost of MP3 radio decoding on 3DS. NEWS and CUTSCENE streams become
24 kHz mono MP3. The large source VB streams and redundant `SET0` through
`SET6` split banks are not copied; the active merged `sfx.RAW` and `sfx.sdt`
gameplay sound library is retained.

See [`stories/README.md`](stories/README.md) for the complete reLCS-specific
setup, controls, features and cheat-code reference.

## Building from source

### Host prerequisites

Production builds require devkitARM release 55 / GCC 10.2, which is not
distributed in this repository. On both Linux and macOS, build the toolchain
and devkitPro host tools from source as described below. The old binary
downloader returns 403 for the required historical files; a current devkitPro
installation is not a replacement for r55.
A newer system compiler can produce an executable that links cleanly but fails
on hardware because these ports use legacy libctru/newlib-era code.

Keep symbolic links intact when cloning or extracting the source. You will need:

- a POSIX shell, GNU Make, `rsync`, `md5sum` and normal Unix build tools;
- devkitPro host tools (bin2s, Picasso, 3dsxtool and smdhtool);
- a source-built devkitARM release 55 / GCC 10.2 compiler tree;
- `ffmpeg` for VC/LCS audio preparation, Python 3 for VC, and a host C++ compiler for LCS.

Command Line Tools and Homebrew on macOS, or the system packages on Linux,
provide the host build dependencies, not the required r55 SDK. After building
the SDK, point `DEVKITARM` at its compiler tree and `DEVKITPRO` at its root.
For example:

```sh
export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
export DEVKITARM=/path/to/devkitARM-r55
export PATH="$DEVKITARM/bin:$DEVKITPRO/tools/bin:$PATH"
```

The build helper honors these variables and defaults to the conventional
`/opt/devkitpro` layout when they are not set.

### Linux and macOS: build r55 from official sources

Use this source-build route on both Linux and macOS.
Cloning the latest buildscripts is not enough: it builds a different compiler,
and historical scripts still try to download archives from the old server.
We pin the r55 scripts and prefetch their sources from GNU and Sourceware.
The versions, source scripts and URLs below were checked, but the full SDK
bootstrap has not yet been tested end-to-end here on either OS. Building the
games with an existing r55 SDK is not the same as testing an SDK bootstrap.
Allow several GB of disk space and use paths that contain no spaces.

#### 1. Host dependencies and working directories

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian, x86-64):**

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential git curl ca-certificates autoconf automake \
  libtool bison flex texinfo pkg-config libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev \
  zlib1g-dev libncurses-dev libreadline-dev libexpat1-dev \
  xz-utils bzip2 rsync python3 ffmpeg
```

Other Linux distributions need the equivalent development packages.

**macOS:** install Xcode Command Line Tools and Homebrew first. The pinned
r55 scripts use Intel-era `/usr/local` include/library paths. The commands
below therefore target an Intel Mac, or an x86-64 shell under Rosetta with a
separate Intel Homebrew on Apple Silicon. Native arm64 SDK bootstrapping is
not covered; do not mix `/opt/homebrew` arm64 libraries into this build.

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

Wait for installation to finish (skip it if Command Line Tools are already
installed). On Apple Silicon, start a Rosetta shell with `arch -x86_64 /bin/bash`
after installing Rosetta and Intel Homebrew. In that shell, or on an Intel Mac:

```sh
test -x /usr/local/bin/brew
eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
brew install autoconf automake libtool bison flex texinfo pkg-config \
  gmp mpfr libmpc xz coreutils rsync python ffmpeg
export PATH="$(brew --prefix bison)/bin:$(brew --prefix flex)/bin:$(brew --prefix texinfo)/bin:$PATH"
export OSXSDKPATH="$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)"
```

Modern macOS SDKs/Clang may need further compatibility patches for these old
sources. This is an unverified bootstrap route, not a claim that r55 builds
unchanged on every macOS release. A Linux x86-64 VM is an alternative for
building both the SDK and games; its compiler binaries will not run on macOS.

**Both systems:** use the same shell for the remaining steps.

```sh
export REGTA_SDK="$HOME/devkitpro-r55"
export REGTA_SDK_SRC="$HOME/regta-sdk-source"
mkdir -p "$REGTA_SDK" "$REGTA_SDK_SRC/archives"
cd "$REGTA_SDK_SRC"
```

#### 2. Compiler, Binutils and Newlib

This commit identifies itself as r55 and selects GCC 10.2.0, Binutils 2.34
and Newlib 3.3.0. Do not substitute the `v20201105` tag: that is r54.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/devkitPro/buildscripts.git
git -C buildscripts checkout ef789eddb72421c1b3774767c02ee519cb38fc9e
cd "$REGTA_SDK_SRC/archives"
curl -fL --retry 3 -O https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-10.2.0/gcc-10.2.0.tar.xz
curl -fL --retry 3 -O https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.34.tar.xz
curl -fL --retry 3 -O https://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/newlib-3.3.0.tar.gz
xz -t gcc-10.2.0.tar.xz binutils-2.34.tar.xz
gzip -t newlib-3.3.0.tar.gz

cd "$REGTA_SDK_SRC/buildscripts"
cat > config.sh <<EOF
BUILD_DKPRO_PACKAGE=1
BUILD_DKPRO_INSTALLDIR="$REGTA_SDK"
BUILD_DKPRO_SRCDIR="$REGTA_SDK_SRC/archives"
BUILD_DKPRO_SKIP_CRTLS=1
BUILD_DKPRO_AUTOMATED=0
export MAKEFLAGS="-j2"
EOF
bash ./build-devkit.sh
```

The scripts apply devkitARM's own patches; generic ARM GCC is not a substitute.
They reuse the three downloaded archives. Rules and startup objects are skipped
in this step and installed from Git below, avoiding the remaining old-server
downloads. Accept the displayed installation directory; answer **n** to the
final cleanup question if you want to keep the intermediate files. Do not build
as root. Keep `-j2` on a small VM; higher parallelism needs more RAM.

#### 3. Matching rules and startup objects

These old Makefiles use `/opt/devkitpro` inside `DESTDIR`. Stage their output
and copy it into the private SDK rather than overwriting a system installation.

```sh
export DEVKITPRO="$REGTA_SDK"
export DEVKITARM="$DEVKITPRO/devkitARM"
export PATH="$DEVKITARM/bin:$DEVKITPRO/tools/bin:$PATH"
cd "$REGTA_SDK_SRC"
git clone --branch v1.2.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/devkitPro/devkitarm-rules.git
make -C devkitarm-rules install DESTDIR="$REGTA_SDK_SRC/rules-stage"
cp -a "$REGTA_SDK_SRC/rules-stage/opt/devkitpro/devkitARM/." "$DEVKITARM/"
git clone --branch v1.0.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/devkitPro/devkitarm-crtls.git
make -C devkitarm-crtls -j2
make -C devkitarm-crtls install DESTDIR="$REGTA_SDK_SRC/crtls-stage"
cp -a "$REGTA_SDK_SRC/crtls-stage/opt/devkitpro/devkitARM/." "$DEVKITARM/"
```

#### 4. Host tools and checks

Build `bin2s`, `3dsxtool`, `smdhtool` and the Picasso shader assembler for your host OS:

```sh
cd "$REGTA_SDK_SRC"
for tool in general-tools 3dstools picasso; do
  git clone "https://github.com/devkitPro/$tool.git" || break
  (
    set -e
    cd "$tool"
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix="$DEVKITPRO/tools"
    make -j2
    make install
  ) || break
done
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
arm-none-eabi-gcc -dumpfullversion
test -f "$DEVKITARM/3ds_rules"
test -f "$DEVKITARM/arm-none-eabi/lib/armv6k/fpu/3dsx_crt0.o"
command -v bin2s picasso 3dsxtool smdhtool
```

Expect **devkitARM release 55** and **10.2.0**. Keep the DEVKITPRO, DEVKITARM
and PATH exports in your shell startup file, or repeat them in each terminal.
The game compiles its bundled libctru, Citro3D, librw and audio libraries; do
not replace them with current prebuilt 3DS libraries.

#### 5. Clone and build the games

```sh
cd "$HOME"
git clone https://github.com/Epic0522/REGTA-3DSPort-Complete.git
cd REGTA-3DSPort-Complete
./scripts/verify-layout.sh
./scripts/build.sh all
```

Clone this fork instead if you want its additional docs and fixes:
`git clone https://github.com/sillyas2010/REGTA-3DSPort-Complete.git`.

The build checks the compiler version, not a private developer directory;
your SDK does not need to live inside this repository. Git preserves the shared
dependency symlinks. ZIP extraction or copying through a filesystem without
symlink support may break them, so run the layout check before compiling.

If bootstrap fails, report the OS version, CPU architecture, host compiler,
buildscripts commit and **first
actual error**, not just the last `make` line. A 403 during download and a C/C++
compiler error after extraction are different problems. Newer host compilers
and macOS SDKs may need additional compatibility work for these historical sources;
do not silently replace the r55 target toolchain with current GCC.

### Verify and compile (existing SDK)

Start from the repository root and verify the shared dependency links before
building:

```sh
./scripts/verify-layout.sh
```

Build one game or all three:

```sh
./scripts/build.sh re3
./scripts/build.sh revc
./scripts/build.sh relcs
./scripts/build.sh all
```

Expected outputs:

```text
III/build/re3.elf
III/build/re3.3dsx
miami/build/miami.elf
miami/build/miami.3dsx
stories/build/relcs.elf
stories/build/relcs.3dsx
```

Vice City builds as `miami.3dsx`; the install helper renames it to `revc.3dsx`.
The build helper sets the loading and lower-screen options used by the tested
builds, plus `OPTIMIZED_BUILD=1` for Vice City.

Do not reuse object files produced by another compiler or important flag set.
Clean only the affected tree and then rebuild it:

```sh
make -C III/build -f GNUmakefile clean       # GTA III
make -C miami/build -f GNUmakefile clean     # Vice City
make -C stories/build -f GNUmakefile clean   # LCS
```

Then rerun the matching `./scripts/build.sh` command. Test the result on your
console, especially after changing the compiler or build flags.

## Installing a 3DSX

Copy the build to your SD card with:

```sh
./scripts/install-3dsx.sh re3   "/Volumes/SD/3ds"
./scripts/install-3dsx.sh revc  "/Volumes/SD/3ds"
./scripts/install-3dsx.sh relcs "/Volumes/SD/3ds"
```

This produces `/3ds/re3.3dsx`, `/3ds/revc.3dsx` or `/3ds/relcs.3dsx`. The game
data remains in the directory shown in the architecture table above.

## CIA packaging

Once all three ELF files are built, you can package them as CIAs:

```sh
./packaging/production_cia/build_production.sh
```

The finished CGFX banners, encoded banner audio and 48×48 icons are included in
[packaging/prebuilt](packaging/prebuilt/README.md). Packaging uses them directly;
Blender, pycgfx, ImageMagick and the original vehicle assets are not needed.

Install zsh, bannertool, `makerom` and `3dsxtool` separately and put the
tools on `PATH`. You can also specify their executable paths with
`BANNERTOOL`, `MAKEROM` and `THREEDSXTOOL`. The generated banners,
icons and game packages are written only to the ignored output folder.

The completed packages are written to:

```text
packaging/production_cia/output/GTA3 For Nintendo 3DS.cia
packaging/production_cia/output/GTAVC For Nintendo 3DS.cia
packaging/production_cia/output/GTALCS For Nintendo 3DS.cia
```

| Game | Title ID | Product code | Long HOME title |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GTA III | `00040000002F6000` | `CTR-P-0RE3` | Grand Theft Auto III |
| Vice City | `00040000002F6100` | `CTR-P-REVC` | Grand Theft Auto: Vice City |
| Liberty City Stories | `00040000002F6200` | `CTR-P-RLCS` | Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories |

Production CIAs use New 3DS 804 MHz mode, L2 cache, expanded application
memory, direct SDMC access and the required video service. They contain no
commercial RomFS data and always load the original game files from the SD card.

CIA and 3DSX builds use the same SD data and saves.

### Build and setup troubleshooting

- `verify-layout.sh` reporting a missing dependency normally means symbolic
  links were flattened or one game tree was moved away from `common`. Restore
  the repository layout before compiling.
- `md5sum: command not found` occurs while makefiles calculate their build
  fingerprint. Install GNU coreutils; substituting macOS `md5` does not match
  the options used by the makefiles.
- A compiler-version or stale-fingerprint failure requires the affected
  makefile's `clean` target followed by `build.sh`; do not delete another game
  tree or the shared libraries.
- LCS setup errors about `.VB`, `sfx.RAW` or `gta_lcs.DAT` mean the selected
  directory is not the expected extracted PS2 data root. Select the directory
  that directly contains `AUDIO`, `DATA` and `models`.
- During Vice City radio conversion, FFmpeg may report `Error submitting packet
  to decoder: Invalid data found when processing input` once per original ADF.
  The stock streams contain a rejected packet, but conversion continues. If
  setup reaches `Prepared revc data` and the WAV files in `3ds/miami/Audio`
  play normally, no action is required.
- If CIA packaging cannot find bannertool, `makerom` or `3dsxtool`, check
  that the tool is installed and its path is set.
- A package that reaches HOME Menu but cannot find data usually has the wrong
  runtime directory or letter case. CIA builds still require `/3ds/re3`,
  `/3ds/miami` or `/3ds/relcs` exactly as documented.
- A very slow first launch with no native texture cache can be normal. Do not
  interrupt cache generation merely because ELF and CIA construction were
  quick.

## Shared Nintendo 3DS interface

All three games use Nintendo button labels and the same basic controls:

- Circle Pad controls movement or steering.
- C-stick controls the camera.
- ABXY, L/R and ZL/ZR are mapped to the games' native actions.
- START pauses and SELECT cycles the gameplay camera.
- The lower screen presents loading progress, radar/status information and
  contextual touch controls.
- Touch the lower screen once to reveal the overlay. The first touch only
  reveals it; release, then tap L3/R3 or drag the Camera region.
- The overlay hides after five seconds without touch input.
- Press L + R + ZL + ZR together during gameplay to open the 3DS system
  keyboard for text cheat entry.

Some actions differ between games; follow the in-game tutorials and button
prompts for those.

## Changelog

### September 25, 2026

- Made draw distance recover much faster after frame pressure falls; switching from Stereo to Flat
  now restores the full world immediately and measures Flat mode again from a clean history.
- Kept building window lights and other attached 2D lighting effects hidden whenever their carrier
  model is outside its current adaptive LOD range in all three games.
- Bound separate night-window geometry to the actual high-detail or LOD buildings beneath it in all
  three games, preventing illuminated window polygons from remaining visible over an empty section of world.
- Fixed LCS building handoff gaps by keeping each low-detail instance visible until its matching
  high-detail map entity has completed its fade and is ready to render fully opaque.
- Kept LCS Stereo light carriers resident under adaptive pressure, and made moving lamp shadows use
  elapsed game time between rendered frames so Stereo frame skipping cannot slow their movement or fade.
- Handed garage, safehouse, fixed, scripted and cutscene cameras fully back to the original camera
  system in all three games. LCS script teleports retain their native camera restore or jump cut for the
  complete frame, and the custom follow camera is rebased only after the original shot ends.
- Kept the vehicle being entered or exited out of normal follow-camera obstacle queries so close entry
  angles can orbit continuously into the rear follow view instead of stalling beside the body and jumping.

### September 24, 2026

#### Stereo and display

- Added stereoscopic 3D to all three games, with **Flat** and **Stereo** display modes.
- Added separate **Quality** and **Performance** profiles for both display modes.
- Added Normal View and Extended Depth options for Stereo mode.
- Added a clear on-screen summary when changing the display mode, quality profile or depth.
- Repeated profile inputs now show the current selection without rewriting the INI file.
- Corrected HUD, location, vehicle, radio and help-text timing while Stereo mode is active.
- Restored smooth fades for distant buildings, vegetation, vehicles and pedestrians.
- Made vegetation LOD fades complete once triggered instead of remaining as a stationary
  half-billboard, half-mesh blend at the switching boundary.
- Extended the high-detail vegetation range in both Flat profiles to reduce visible model changes.
- Fixed vehicle glass and transparent materials disappearing in Stereo mode.

#### Performance and rendering

- Added adaptive frame pacing for steadier movement when a scene cannot sustain its full frame rate.
- Draw distance in both Flat and Stereo now follows recent missed-frame frequency, reducing the overall
  world range first and shortening distant high-detail models only if pressure remains high.
- Reduced CPU and GPU work shared by both eyes instead of repeating unchanged scene preparation.
- Reduced geometry submission, texture changes and material-state overhead in busy scenes.
- Improved skinned-character, immediate-mode and MatFX rendering on the 3DS GPU.
- Added load-aware budgets for distant traffic, pedestrians, particles, lights, shadows and small effects.
- Prioritised the player, mission actors and nearby vehicles when the scene is under pressure.
- Reduced the cost of high-detail vehicles while preserving their reflections and visible body parts.
- Refined building and vehicle LOD ranges to keep nearby detail while reducing distant rendering cost.
- Improved vegetation batching and fading without shortening objects that have no lower-detail model.
- Restored GTA III's original light-blue colour filter in Stereo mode.
- Removed detailed profiling and CSV logging from production builds.

#### Camera

- Added smooth transitions between pedestrian, vehicle, top-down, bonnet and cinematic cameras.
- Kept the player or vehicle framed while changing camera height, angle and follow distance.
- Smoothed vehicle entry, exit, carjacking, knockdown and other game-controlled camera movements.
- Prevented exit cameras from settling at extreme low angles or behind the vehicle and nearby scenery.
- Prevented rapid spins, excessive tilt and abrupt distance changes during camera hand-offs.
- Manual camera input now takes control immediately during a transition, then settles at the selected
  near, middle or far follow distance.
- Camera rotation now stops at solid obstacles instead of pushing the viewpoint through them.
- Only geometry touching the camera is faded, preventing unrelated scenery in front of the player
  from disappearing.
- Vehicles and occupants now fade smoothly during close bonnet and cinematic transitions.

#### Stability and installation

- Improved audio streaming and prefetching to reduce radio, station-change and ambient-audio stalls.
- Improved renderer and audio shutdown when returning to HOME or powering off from a game.
- Added a startup integrity check for every replacement file supplied by this project.
- Supplied replacements must match their exact size and SHA-256; missing or modified files stop
  startup and identify the affected path.
- Original game data and player-converted audio remain compatible across supported source versions
  and are checked for usability rather than one fixed checksum.

## Texture caches and first launch

The pause menu also caches its textures in 3DS-native format, beside the original
menu TXDs as `*.menu3ds-v1`. The first load creates these files; later loads reuse
them without converting the PC textures again. Closing the menu releases its
textures from memory. Controller diagrams are excluded; button prompts remain.
Replacing a source TXD (changed size or modification time) invalidates its cache.
Delete these generated files to force a rebuild. They are not release assets.

`models/txd.img` and `models/txd.dir` are generated native texture caches, not
original source assets. When they are absent, a build with `USE_TXD_CDIMAGE`
can create them from the installed game data. First-time conversion on the
console may take a long time. Preserve a known-good generated cache unless the
underlying textures or converter change.

The capability record (`DATA/CAPS.DAT` in LCS) is generated with the cache.
A fresh setup will not contain that record, the texture cache or personal
settings until the game creates them.

Use caches made by the matching converter, with mipmaps intact. An old or
incorrectly converted cache can still cause texture problems or slow streaming
even if its filenames are correct.

## Save data

Each game stores settings and saves under its own runtime directory:

```text
sdmc:/3ds/re3/userfiles/
sdmc:/3ds/miami/userfiles/
sdmc:/3ds/relcs/userfiles/
```

Back up `userfiles` before replacing save-conversion tools, testing modified
scripts, or migrating from an older runtime path. The setup helper preserves
an existing destination save directory, but a manual folder replacement may
not.

## Known limitations

- New 3DS-family hardware is required.
- Initial native texture conversion can be slow.
- Very busy scenes and demanding cutscenes can still cause frame drops or
  audio stutter.
- Environments without working MVD color conversion cannot start the renderer,
  including emulators that only stub out that service. This is a hardware
  dependency, not a guarantee against modified builds or future emulation.
- ASI plugins, CLEO scripts, binary desktop patches and desktop limit adjusters
  do not work. Their functionality must be integrated into source and rebuilt.
- reLCS required more reconstruction than re3 or reVC. The main story is
  playable to the end, but not every unused PSP/PS2 feature has been recreated.
- LCS main-story completion has been verified on a physical New Nintendo 3DS.
  Side missions and other optional activities have not yet been verified.

## Reporting bugs

If you run into a problem, please open an Issue in this repository. Include
as much of the following as you can:

- The game, build or commit, console model, and whether you use CIA or 3DSX.
- The mission name or location, steps to reproduce the problem, what you
  expected to happen, and what actually happened.
- Whether it happens every time, only after extended play, or after loading
  a save; mention any cheats or mods used.
- The crash dump (`crash_dump_*.dmp`) if one was generated, plus any relevant
  logs.
- Screenshots or a short video showing the problem. A save from just before
  the issue is helpful too.

You can still report a bug without a dump—for freezes, missing objects and
mission problems, clear reproduction steps and pictures are often more useful.
